# Crowd-Counting

This machine learning project uses computer vision techniques to count the number of people entering and exiting a mall.

## Project Summary
The system uses OpenCV and Python to detect and track people in video feeds from cameras placed at mall entrances and exits.
The number of people entering and exiting is counted and displayed on a dashboard.
The total count of people inside the mall is calculated and displayed.
Alerts can be set to notify if the number of people exceeds a threshold.
Data is stored in an Excel sheet for the admin to view and update.

## How it Works
The video feed from the cameras is broken down into frames.
Each frame is processed using a pre-trained MobileNetSSD object detection model to detect people.
Bounding boxes are drawn around each detected person.
As people enter and exit frames, the counts are incremented or decremented accordingly.
The total count is calculated and displayed on the dashboard.
The data is stored in an Excel sheet when the system closes.
